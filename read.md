Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary packages (telegram, requests, uptime).
Create a Telegram bot and obtain the API token.
Create a BinCodes account and obtain the API key.
Implement the start, bin, join, and list_commands functions to handle user commands.
Add a function to check the bot’s uptime.
Deploy the bot to a server or cloud platform (e.g. Heroku, AWS, GCP).
Test the bot and make sure it’s working as expected.
Add error handling and logging to improve the app’s reliability and maintainability.
Consider adding more features to the bot, such as caching bin data, handling multiple bin numbers at once, or integrating with other APIs.
Here’s a breakdown of the work involved:

Set up virtual environment and install packages - 1 hour
Create Telegram bot and obtain API token - 30 minutes
Create BinCodes account and obtain API key - 30 minutes
Implement functions for handling user commands - 4 hours
Add function to check bot’s uptime - 1 hour
Deploy bot to server or cloud platform - 2 hours
Test bot and ensure it’s working as expected - 1 hour
Add error handling and logging - 2 hours
Add more features (optional) - 4 hours
